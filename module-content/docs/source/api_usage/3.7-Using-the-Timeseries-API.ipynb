    "\n",
    "The GridAPPS-D Sensor Service simulates the noise and packet losses of real field device measurements based upon the magnitude of “prestine” simulated values from the GridLab-D simulation. This service has been specifically designed to work within the gridappsd platform container. The GridAPPS-D platform will start the service when it is specified as a dependency of an application or when a service configuration is specified within the GridAPPS-D Visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Python Application Usage:__\n",
    "The python application using this service should require gridappsd-sensor-simulator as a requirement. In addition, the following python code shows how to get the correct topic for the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Service Configuration:__\n",
    "The sensor-config in the above image shows an example of how to configure a portion of the system to have sensor output. Each mrid (such as `_99db0dc7-ccda-4ed5-a772-a7db362e9818`) will be monitored by this service and either use the default values or use the specified values during the service runtime.\n",
