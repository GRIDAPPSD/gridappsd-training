    "A key concept in GridAPPS-D and CIM XML power system models is the difference between the object mRID of a piece of equipment and multiple measurement mRIDs associated with its control settings and power flow values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements differ from the state variables (e.g. those obtained from State Estimator or a power flow calculation) in that the values are measured here and not calculated or estimated. Each Measurement is associated to a _PowerSystemResource_, and in GridAPPS-D for now, also a Terminal that belongs to the same _PowerSystemResource_. (Non-electrical measurements, for example weather, would not have the Terminal). \n",

    "\n",
    "* __POS__ -- Position for switches and transformer taps\n",
    "\n",
    "Each measurement object has a __name__, __mRID__, and __phases__. In GridAPPS-D, each phase is measured individually so multi-phase codes like ABC should not be used. \n",

    "Pos measurements will be discrete, for such things as tap position, switch position, or capacitor bank position. \n",
    "\n",
